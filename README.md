# Snake Game

## Introduction
The Snake Game is a classic game where players control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and their own body. This web-based version of the game allows users to play it in a browser.

## Game Rules
- The game map is a rectangular field consisting of a grid of 30x20 cells.
- Players control the snake's movement direction using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
- The snake starts with a length of 1 unit and grows longer each time it eats food.
- Food appears randomly on the map, ensuring it does not overlap with the snake's body.
- The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body. Players lose a life when this happens.
- The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible and achieve a high score.
- The game interface displays the current score, remaining lives, and a timer.
- Players can choose to restart the game or exit.

## Development Process
The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file (index.html) creates the structure of the webpage, while the CSS file (style.css) defines the game's visual style. The JavaScript file (script.js) implements the game logic and functionality.

The game logic includes:
- Creating the game grid and snake.
- Generating food at random positions.
- Handling keyboard input to control the snake's movement.
- Moving the snake and checking for collisions.
- Updating the scoreboard.
- Starting, ending, and restarting the game.

## Usage
To play the Snake Game, open the index.html file in a web browser. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement. Eat food to increase your score and avoid collisions to stay alive. The game ends when all lives are lost. You can restart the game by clicking the "Start" button.
